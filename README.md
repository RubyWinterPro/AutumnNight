## About AutumnNight
AutumnNight is a 2D Rogue-Like Platformer started in Unreal Engine 5 and is being remade in Unity.

The goal of Autumn is to complete as many levels as possible with the generation being randomized. It also has a focus on accessibility, supporting many different control layouts.

You can find AutumnNight on [itch.io](https;//itch.io).

## Support
AutumnNight is made to be free to access and use, but you can support it by donating! This is to make sure that Ruby can support this game.
